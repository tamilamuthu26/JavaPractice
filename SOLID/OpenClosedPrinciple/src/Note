A registry is an extensible plugin mechanism.
Updating a registry is not modifying behavior, it is registering new behavior.

✔ Yes, registry is related to Dependency Injection
because you inject a map of strategies instead of hardcoding logic.

✔ Yes, it still follows Open/Closed Principle
because:
No existing classes change
Only new classes are added
The registry update is considered configuration, not modification of logic
